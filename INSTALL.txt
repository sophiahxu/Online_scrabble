Installation Process: 

1) Download .zip file of source code

2) $ cd /path/to/scrabble/folder

    * $ update opam

    * Make sure graphics package is installed.
    
        opam install graphics

  *Note* Windows might have an issue displaying the GUI: 
  In order to display the GUI from a WSL, host an ssh server on your WSL with 
  X11 forwarding enabled. Install and launch an XServer (we use Xming) on your 
  windows machine. Install and open PuTTY on Windows and connect to your linux
  server with X11 forwarding enabled and set to localhost:0.0. For detailed 
  instructions, see the Windows setup instructions below. If you've already
  completed the initial setup, follow the reccuring setup for windows every time
  you wish to play scrabble.

    * Start your server with the following command:
      
        sudo service ssh start

3) Find your IP address on your WSL.

5) From your PuTTY terminal, follow the instructions above to launch the 
   scrabble game.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows recurring setup instructions (to set up your server before every
scrabble session):

1) Make sure XMing is running, if not launch XMing.
	
    * You should only have to relaunch XMing every time you shut down your
      computer.

    * You can tell XMing is running if the icon appears in your system tray
      (depending on your system, the tray appears at the bottom of your screen, 
      and Xming will either be in the bottom bar or inside a menu that can be 
      accessed through the "^" on the bottom right hand side of the bottom bar).

2) Make sure your ssh server is running.
	
    * You should only have to restart your server every time you shut down your
    computer.	

    * Run the following command to see if your server is running:
      
        service ssh status
    
    * If it is still running, you can use the same server settings in PuTTY and 
      you are all set with step 2, otherwise you have to start the server again 
      with the following command:

        sudo service ssh start

    * Obtain your new IP address using the following command:
    
        ifconfig

3) Connect to your ssh server through PuTTY.

    * Open PuTTY. If you did not have to restart your server, you can simply 
      "load" the previously saved server settings and click "open". Otherwise,
      load the previous settings, and update the IP address to match your new IP
      address obtained in step 2. Save your new settings and click "open".

    * If there is a popup over the PuTTY terminal, select "accept". Input your
      ubuntu username, and then your ubuntu password.

4) From your PuTTY terminal, follow the instructions above to launch the 
   scrabble game.
